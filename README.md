## 🧩 STAGE 1 — Learn Lisp Foundations

### 🎯 Goal

Understand Lisp syntax, list processing, recursion, macros, and functional thinking.
This is where you learn to *think in Lisp* — treating code as data.

### 🧠 Learn

* **Basic Lisp syntax:** atoms, lists, functions.
* **Recursion & higher-order functions**
* **Macros:** write code that writes code.
* **REPL workflow:** iterative, exploratory programming.

### 🛠️ Tools

* **SBCL** (Steel Bank Common Lisp)
* **Emacs + SLIME** or **VSCode + Alive** plugin
* **Book:** *Practical Common Lisp* (Peter Seibel)
* **Exercise site:** [https://exercism.org/tracks/common-lisp](https://exercism.org/tracks/common-lisp)

### ⚙️ Mini Projects

* A **symbolic math evaluator**
* A **rule-based chatbot** (simple expert system)
* A **macro-based DSL** (like a mission script language)

---

# 🧠 STAGE 2 — AI, Reasoning, and Planning Systems

### 🎯 Goal

Use Lisp to build symbolic and cognitive systems.

### 🧠 Learn

* Knowledge representation (facts, rules, frames)
* Search and planning algorithms (A*, STRIPS)
* Logic systems (predicate logic, backward chaining)
* Metaprogramming (writing reasoning frameworks)

### 🛠️ Tools

* **Common Lisp** or **Clojure**
* **CLIPS / Jess** (rule-based systems)
* **ACL2** (formal verification)
* **Libraries:** Quicklisp, CL-JSON, Alexandria, Iterate

### ⚙️ Projects

* **Autonomous decision system** — define “mission rules” and “world state”
* **Reasoning engine** — like a small theorem prover
* **AI planner** — symbolic planning and goal reasoning

---

# 🧱 STAGE 3 — Secure OS & Reproducible Systems

### 🎯 Goal

Understand **functional system configuration** and **reproducible environments**, inspired by Guix and NixOS.

### 🧠 Learn

* Purely functional package management (no side effects)
* Declarative OS configuration
* Reproducible build pipelines
* Guile Scheme (Lisp dialect used in Guix)

### 🛠️ Tools

* **GNU Guix** (run it in a VM or container)
* **Guile Scheme**
* **Racket** (optional, for experimenting with language design)

### ⚙️ Projects

* Write a **custom package definition** in Guix.
* Build a **reproducible environment** for your AI code.
* Create a **Lisp DSL for OS policies** (e.g., user privileges, services).

---

# 🤖 STAGE 4 — Robotics & Control Systems

### 🎯 Goal

Use Lisp reasoning systems to control simulated or real robots.

### 🧠 Learn

* Control loops, perception-action reasoning
* Symbolic + reactive hybrid architectures
* Behavior trees, planners, reactive layers
* Integration with ROS or simulation environments

### 🛠️ Tools

* **Common Lisp + roslisp** (ROS client)
* **Clojure + clj-ros / Java ROS libs**
* **Simulation:** Gazebo, Webots, or V-REP

### ⚙️ Projects

* Simulate a **search-and-rescue robot** with rule-based decision-making.
* Write a **Lisp planner** that commands a robot to achieve goals.
* Build a **robot behavior DSL** for mission scripts.

---

# 🧬 STAGE 5 — Integration & Advanced Projects

### 🎯 Goal

Combine AI + Secure OS + Robotics into coherent, reproducible systems.

### 🧠 Ideas

* Build a **self-contained AI agent** running in Guix, with reproducible configuration.
* Develop a **mission control framework**: Lisp reasoning engine + Nix/Guix-managed environment.
* Design a **hybrid symbolic-neural agent** (using Clojure + Python interop).
* Prototype a **policy-verifiable embedded system** using Guile Scheme + ACL2.

# 🔒 SECURITY AND DEFENSE-FOCUSED TRACK

If your emphasis is on **secure defense software**, focus your roadmap like this:

| Layer        | Tool                                 | Purpose                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Verification | **ACL2**                             | Prove properties about code (used by NASA, DARPA) |
| OS Layer     | **Guix (Guile Scheme)**              | Reproducible and declarative system               |
| AI Logic     | **Common Lisp or Clojure**           | Symbolic reasoning, planning                      |
| Integration  | **Lisp-based microservices / CLIPS** | Combine reasoning with control systems            |
